This is a service i previously ran for free on glitch.com to serve player skins for the discord-bridge i host on various teeworlds servers: https://discord.gg/RCDz5wcGF8
Most of the files are boilerplate generated by glitch.com. Only files edited are server.js and /skins/.

note from 2025: The code is from 2022 & very messy. Focus was on functionality. iirc i tried to copy the functionality from https://teeassembler.developer.li/ by [@AlexIsTheGuy](https://github.com/AlexIsTheGuy)

api endpoints: /render/:skin/:color_body/:color_feet and /render/:skin

steps to run:
npm install
npm start
